----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in V1.3
New window if no markers were found.
Window position and size, chart visibilities and line style settings are now stored with the document.
Some minor tweaks.

Changes in V1.2
New chart properties: square, straight, and round
Thicker lines and bigger legend with enlarged window

Changes in V1.1
Simplified syntax: Emotion markers must be enclosed in double square brackets, such as [[@John=30]] or [[@Martha=50 @John=40]].
Markers in the description line must look like “= Scene description [[@John=10]]”; unfortunately, the old markers no longer work.
Text excerpts in tooltips are split across multiple lines if necessary.
Tooltip areas are now much smaller and less magnetic.
Clicking on a marker jumps to that marker in the text and highlights only the value.
The window resizing is now responsive. 
Shortened legend for the X-axis.

Description

This plugin creates interactive emotion charts showing emotional journeys of characters or storylines throughout your script. Track emotional highs and lows, compare multiple characters, storylines, and visualize dramatic arcs with precision.

Quick Start Guide

1. Adding Emotion Markers
In your screenplay, use double square brackets with "@" before the subject followed by "=" and a number between 0 and 100.
For example [[@Character=50]] (also inline within dialogue/action), also combined like [[@Char1=50 @Char2=70]]
You can add motion Markers also in Scene description like = What will happen in the scene [[@Character=75]]

You can also use overall parameters like [[@suspense=65]] or: = Scene description [[@absurdity=15]]

2. Using the Chart
Click points to jump to corresponding script positions
Click legend names to show/hide specific charts
Choose between 3 different line styles: square, straight, and round
Hover points to see scene snippets (what happened before?) and values

3. Interpretation
Y-axis: Emotional value (0-100 scale)
X-axis: Script timeline with section markers
Colors: Each character has unique color
Vertical lines: Scene/section boundaries

4. Best Practices
Use consistent names (case-insensitive)
You can leave the plugin window open while editing, since the plugin automatically refreshes the content. 
Place markers at emotional turning points, maybe start with Markers in Scene descriptions, later after specific actions/dialogue
